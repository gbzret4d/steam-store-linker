# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Game Store Enhancer** userscript will be documented in this file.



## [1.32] - 2026-02-04
### Changed
- **Project Structure**: Renamed project to **Game Store Enhancer** to reflect support for multiple stores (Humble, Fanatical, DIG, GOG).
- **File Name**: Userscript renamed to `game_store_enhancer.user.js`.
- **Repo Links**: Updated all update/download URLs to point to the new `game-store-enhancer` repository.

## [1.31] - 2026-02-04
### Added
- **GOG**: Added support for **GOG.com**.
  - Works on **Store**, **Product Pages**, **Wishlist**, **Library**, and **Order History**.
  - **Deduplication**: Uses internal GOG Product IDs to prevent re-scanning the same game multiple times on a page.
  - **Language Agnostic**: Selectors work on both English (`/en/`) and German (`/de/`) versions.

## [1.30] - 2026-02-04
### Added
- **DailyIndieGame**: Added full support for **DailyIndieGame.com**.
  - Works on **Marketplace**, **Bundles**, and **Product Pages**.
  - **Native Integration**: Replaces the site's default "View on Steam" text/links with our enhanced stats badge.
  - **Performance**: Uses the site's URL structure to grab the Steam AppID directly, bypassing the Steam Search API entirely for instant results.

## [1.29] - 2026-02-03
### Added
- **Fanatical**: Added support for **User Pages**.
  - The script now works on **Product Library** (`/product-library`) and **Order History** (`/orders`).
  - Correctly detects game titles in these list views and adds Steam links/status.

## [1.28] - 2026-02-03
### Fixed
- **Fanatical**: Added item deduplication for the **Stats Panel**.
  - Duplicate visible items (e.g. valid games appearing in both "Just Launched" carousel and the main list) are now counted only once in the *Total / Owned / Wishlisted* stats.
  - Ensures correct "Total" count even on complex pages like Bundles, while still showing links on all instances.

## [1.26] - 2026-02-03
### Fixed
- **Stats**: Added "No Data" category to the stats panel.
  - Now correctly counts items where no Steam data was found or an error occurred (e.g. invalid ID), ensuring the "Total" count matches the number of items on the page.

## [1.25] - 2026-02-02
### Changed
- **Performance**: Reduced **Cache Duration** from 24 hours to **15 minutes**.
  - *Context*: Active deal hunters need fresher data. 24h was too stale.
  - *Impact*: Ownership/Wishlist status updates much faster.
  - *Note*: Static data (like review scores) is cached for ~1.75 hours (7x base TTL) to respect API limits.

## [1.24] - 2026-02-02
### Fixed
- **Fanatical**: Fixed false positives in Book/Software bundle exclusion.
  - The script now uses **strict equality** checking for breadcrumbs to avoid ignoring legitimate game bundles (e.g. "Hyper VR Bundle") whose parent category text ("PC Game Bundles, Book Bundles...") contained the blocklisted keywords.

## [1.23] - 2026-02-02
### Added
- **Fanatical**: Added **Book & Software Bundle Filter**.
  - The script now intelligently detects "Book Bundles" and "Software Bundles" (via breadcrumbs) and **stops execution** on those pages.
  - *Benefit*: Prevents false positives and meaningless Steam searches for eBooks or software that doesn't exist on Steam.

## [1.18] - 2026-02-02
### Fixed
- **Steam Reviews**: Improved data fetching to include **Key Activations** (`&purchase_type=all`).
  - Corrects missing review scores for games like *Winds of Arcana* that have many reviews from key activations (which were previously ignored by the default API call).
  - Bumped `CACHE_VERSION` to '2.1' to force a data refresh.

## [1.17] - 2026-02-02
### Fixed
- **Fanatical**: Resolved infinite loop when encountering "app/null" entries (e.g., in mini-bundles).
  - Explicitly marks invalid IDs as errors to prevent endless re-scanning.
- **Steam Reviews**: Fixed "null%" display for games with 0 reviews or invalid data.
  - Added safeguards against `NaN` calculations.
  - Hides the review badge entirely if total reviews are 0 (prevents misleading red "0%").
- **Core**: Bumped `CACHE_VERSION` to '2.0' to clear any corrupted "null" data from the cache.

## [1.16] - 2026-02-01
### Fixed
- **UI**: Resolved text clipping in Humble Bundle Grid.
  - Reverted global `outline-offset: -3px` (which caused text like "Keys are low" to be covered).
  - Applied `outline-offset: -3px` **only** to Carousel items where bleeding was an issue.
  - **Result**: Grid text is readable again, and Carousel borders don't overlap. Best of both worlds.

## [1.15] - 2026-02-01
### Fixed
- **UI**: Fixed color bleeding in Humble Bundle Carousel.
  - Added `outline-offset: -3px` to draw the border *inside* the game card. This prevents the blue border of one game from overlapping the red border of the next game when they are tightly packed.

## [1.14] - 2026-02-01
### Fixed
- **Core**: Forced Cache Reset.
  - Bumped internal `CACHE_VERSION` to '1.9' to invalidate all stale cached data. This ensures recent user changes (Wishlist/Ignore) are immediately reflected without waiting 24 hours.

## [1.13] - 2026-02-01
### Fixed
- **Humble Bundle**: Fixed carousel detection for games after the first slide (e.g., "Haste").
  - Updated selector to target `.slick-slide` elements individually so the script doesn't just stop at the first visible game.

## [1.12] - 2026-02-01
### Fixed
- **Core**: Fixed logic for "Ignored" games (handles falsy `0` value from Steam API).
- **Fanatical**: Fixed infinite stats counter loop on dynamic pages.

## [1.11] - 2026-01-31
### Fixed
- **Humble Bundle**: Updated carousel/modal selectors to use verified `.expanded-info-view` class. This ensures Steam links appear correctly when clicking on a game for details.

## [1.10] - 2026-01-31
### Added
- **Humble Bundle**: Initial support for Game Details Carousel/Modal (using generic selectors).

## [1.9] - 2026-01-31
### Changed
- **UI**: Switched from CSS `border` to `outline` for game card highlighting.
  - *Fixes*: Humble Bundle layout breaking from 3 columns to 2 columns due to added border width.
- **UI**: Enhanced visibility of "Owned", "Wishlist", and "Ignored" states with a stronger glow effect (box-shadow).

## [1.8] - 2026-01-31
### Added
- **Feature**: **Steam Reviews Integration**. Now displays review score percentages directly on the game card:
  - <span style="color:#66C0F4">**Blue**</span>: Positive (>70%)
  - <span style="color:#a8926a">**Brown**</span>: Mixed
  - <span style="color:#c15755">**Red**</span>: Negative (<40%)
### Fixed
- **Core**: Fixed "Ownership" detection on Humble Bundle.
  - Enforced strict number type parsing for IDs.
  - Implemented `CACHE_VERSION` to force a cache reset for all users, eliminating stale/broken data.

## [1.7] - 2026-01-31
### Added
- **Fanatical**: Implemented **API Interceptor**.
  - The script now intercepts Fanatical's internal API responses to extract the *exact* Steam App ID directly.
  - **Result**: 100% matching accuracy on Fanatical (supersedes name-based search).

## [1.6] - 2026-01-31
### Fixed
- **Core**: Added **Persistence Check**.
  - Detects if other userscripts (like "Bundle Helper") wipe the added Steam links.
  - Automatically re-applies links if they are removed.

## [1.5] - 2026-01-31
### Fixed
- **Core**: Resolved a syntax error in the userscript header.

## [1.4] - 2026-01-31
### Added
- **Core**: **Content Filter Bypass**. Added `&ignore_preferences=1` to Steam search API to find games even if they are hidden by user preferences (e.g. mature content).
- **Core**: **Asset Scanner**. Priority system that scans for existing Steam images/links on the page to identify games before falling back to text search.

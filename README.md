# Steam Store Linker (Humble & Fanatical)

A Tampermonkey Userscript that enhances **Humble Bundle** and **Fanatical** store pages by adding Steam store links, ownership status, wishlist indicators, bundle statistics, and other useful game info.

## Features

- **Multi-Site Support**: Works on Humble Bundle and Fanatical.

- **Visual Status Icons**:
    - **Owned**: Games you own are marked with a green checkmark check and grayed out.
    - **Wishlist**: Games on your wishlist are marked with a blue heart and highlighted.
    - **Ignored**: Games you have ignored on Steam are marked with a red cross.
- **Advanced Info**:
    - **Steam Deck / ProtonDB**: Shows a colored circle indicating Linux/Deck compatibility (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze, Borked) via ProtonDB.
    - **Trading Cards**: Displays a blue card icon if the game drops Steam Trading Cards.
    - **Content Type**: Distinguishes between base games, **DLCs** (yellow icon), and **Soundtracks** (note icon).
    - **Steam User Rating**: Displays the percentage of positive user reviews from Steam.
- **Stats Panel**: A floating panel shows a summary of the current page (Total, Owned, Missing, etc.).

## Usage

1.  **Login**: Make sure you are logged into [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) in the same browser context.
2.  **Visit**: Go to any supported store page:
    - [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/)
    - [Fanatical](https://www.fanatical.com/)
3.  **Permissions**: The script will ask for permission to access:
    - `store.steampowered.com` (for ownership/search)
    - `www.protondb.com` (for Steam Deck status)
    - **Allow these** to enable full functionality.
4.  **Enjoy**: The stats panel will appear, and game cards will be enriched with Steam data.

## How it works

- **Site Adapters**: Uses modular adapters to find game titles on different websites.
- **Data Sources**:
    - **Steam UserData**: Fetches your owned/wishlisted games from Steam's dynamic store API.
    - **Steam Search**: Finds the correct Steam App ID by game name.
    - **Steam AppDetails**: Fetches secondary info like Trading Cards and DLC type.
    - **ProtonDB API**: Fetches the current Linux/Deck compatibility tier.

## Credits

- **[Revadike/SteamWebIntegration](https://github.com/Revadike/SteamWebIntegration)**: Inspiration for the "Asset Scanner" logic (detecting games via existing Steam images/links).
- **Steam**: For providing the platform and data.
- **SteamDB / ProtonDB**: For their excellent public APIs.
- **Caching**: Results are cached in Tampermonkey storage to respect API rate limits and speed up subsequent page loads.
